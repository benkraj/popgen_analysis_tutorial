# QED Tutorial: analysis of population genomic data in Python and R

This tutorial provides an introduction to analysis of population genomic data in Python and R. In the classroom, we'll discuss the benefits of using a programing language to analyze sequence data, give an overview of the ecosystem of tools available in these languages, and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. We'll then run through a tutorial where we'll learn to load a multisample .vcf file, explore its features and and filter variants based on a number of characteristics, and then calculate a set of typical summary statistics. Lastly, we'll explore options for visualizing these data. Please come with Python 3, R, and RStudio installed on your computer. Please also install the Python package scikit-allel along with all its optional dependencies (via the command $ pip install scikit-allel[full]), and the R packages vcfR, adegenet, ape, poppr, and ggplot2.
